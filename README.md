# riemann_workshop

This repository was used in an internal training exercise at Made.com. We open-sourced it at the time, but never advertised it in any way. The workshop assumes that you have Docker installed and docker-compose, and that you're running some *nix.

In the `docs` directory, there are a bunch of markdown files that will walk you through the process of configuring a monitoring stack using CollectdD, Riemann, Influxdb, and Grafana. Not coincidentally, this is the stack that we use here at Made. There are some suggestions for "advanced" exercises in the final markdown file, but nobody was brave enough to attempt them.

Pull requests and GH issues are welcome if you have solutions, errata, further exercises, or suggestions.
